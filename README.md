## Instructions for Reproducing Results

To reproduce the results of our project:

1) Clone this repository from GitHub
2) Open this repository in Visual Studio Code
3) Install Python and Jupyter in Visual Studio Code
4) Run Cool Tone Code.ipynb to get the cooltonne.csv dataset, as well as Cool Tone Boxplot.png and Cool Tone Histogram.png visualizations
5) Run Warm Tone Code.ipynb to get thewarmtone.csv dataset, as well as Warm Tone Boxplot.png and Warm Tone Histogram.png visualizations
5) Run Pinterest ML Model.ipynb to get a visualization of the importance of each YUV feature (Feature Importance.png) and principle component analysis visualization (PCA.png) to show the distributions of the two datasets
